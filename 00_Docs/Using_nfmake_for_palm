I've just gotten nfmake working for use with prc-tool chain used in
building palm software.  This allows you to build C code using the
prc-tool chain and nfmake.  I did this because the first project I came
across used rm(1) for deleting build products, and due to a bug in the
makefile blew away the root on a windows box I was working on.

Eventually this should make it usable for building Objective-C projects
on palm and compatible platforms.  For now it is limited to building pure
C code.  Due to oddities in the prc-tool (build-prc in particular) chain,
the project does not build like normal PB.project tools or applications.
The PalmApplication.m class is just a first stab and should be cleaned
up later.

Projects build with debugging symbols and can be debugged using
poser/Emulator and m68k-palmos-gdb with good success.

A sample project that uses PB.project and nfmake can be found at
