#1 Lots more documentation:
   about the plist format and the PB.project format, for those not coming from OpenStep
   about what project types are supported, and what commands (ie clean/install)
   about how resources are installed for tools


#2  This was written for my machine, and the machine of others at nfox.com.  We all use an identical build environment, and it probably isn't the same as everyone elses :-)  (For the record, RedHat 6.1, with gcc 2.8.1 (modified), with ld 2.9.1 (modified), with pthreads and the multi-threaded objc (modified), using gnu-gnu-gnu-xgps)  This originally compiled and worked on OSXServer, Yellow Box, Solaris, and GNUstep.  We only use GNUstep in house now, so I no longer actively support it for the Apple platforms.

#3 much better support for nfmakerc.  The goal is for you to be able to define standard options for a machine (such as what libraries to link against), but be able to override them per user, per project, or per build.
